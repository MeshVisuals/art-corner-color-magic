## üöß Current Development Status & Known Issues

### **AI Generation Status**
The app currently attempts to use Hugging Face Spaces for AI image generation but encounters several issues:

### **Issues Encountered:**
1. **Space Availability**: Many Spaces return 404 (not found) or 503 (service unavailable)
2. **Queue System**: Some Spaces use queue systems instead of direct API calls
3. **API Format Variations**: Different Spaces expect different parameter formats
4. **CORS Restrictions**: Browser requests may be blocked by CORS policies

### **Current Implementation:**
- **File**: `src/components/GenerateScreen.tsx` (lines 129-149)
- **Current Space**: `multimodalart-flux-lora-the-explorer.hf.space`
- **Error**: "This API endpoint does not accept direct HTTP POST requests. Please join the queue to use this API."

### **Attempted Solutions:**
1. **FLUX.1-dev official Space** ‚Üí 500 server error
2. **Stable Diffusion 2.1 Space** ‚Üí 403 forbidden
3. **alvdansen-flux-dev** ‚Üí 404 not found
4. **SDXL Lightning** ‚Üí 503 service unavailable
5. **FLUX LoRA Explorer** ‚Üí Queue system, not direct API

### **Working Alternatives:**
- ‚úÖ **Skip Button**: Works perfectly with 14 preset images
- ‚úÖ **Image Upload**: Users can upload their own images
- ‚úÖ **Painting Tools**: Full painting functionality works

### **For Future Development:**
1. **Consider paid Hugging Face API** instead of free Spaces
2. **Implement proper queue handling** for Spaces that support it
3. **Add fallback to other AI services** (OpenAI DALL-E, Stability AI, etc.)
4. **Create new Hugging Face account** for fresh API quota
5. **Use `@gradio/client` package** for proper Space integration

### **Current Recommendation:**
Use the **Skip button** for reliable functionality while AI generation is being stabilized.
