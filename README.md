### **Known Issues - Need to Fix:**

#### üö® **Critical Issues:**
1. **Paint Screen Image Loading**: Images don't display properly on the paint screen (3rd screen)
   - Images load and show on generation screen (2nd screen) 
   - When clicking "Color This!" to go to paint screen, image doesn't appear in canvas
   - Canvas shows empty/white background instead of the image
   - Issue affects both generated and skipped images

#### üîß **UI Issues:**
2. **Prompt Input Field Too Small**: The prompt input field is still very small and needs to be enlarged significantly
3. **Button Spacing Inconsistent**: Upload/Skip/Generate buttons are not evenly spaced like the style selector buttons
4. **Skip Button Workflow**: Skip should show image on generation screen first (currently working) before going to paint

#### üéØ **Technical Root Causes:**
- **Canvas Image Positioning**: Image centering/scaling logic in paint canvas not working correctly
- **Layer Initialization**: Background layer may not be properly loading the image
- **Image URL Passing**: Image URL might not be correctly passed between screens
